# hn-zen

To encourage reading more long form articles, this extension makes Hacker News and Lobsters more zen by doing the following things:

1. When clicking on an article link, it will first load the comments, then load the article. Effectively adding the comments to the browser history for easy access.
2. Add an option to hide points count
3. Add an option to hide comment count

This change in behavior encourage the following experience:
1. Click on an article
2. Read the article
3. Read the comments

Which provides a much more zen experience of reading.
